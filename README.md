# Tosca Obstacle Course with Robot Framework

Welcome to the **Tosca Obstacle Course with Robot Framework** repository! ðŸŽ‰

## What is this repository about?

When you're new to [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), it can be challenging to dive into its capabilities and start practicing effectively. Tosca provides a bit of a head start with its **Obstacle Course**â€”a website where you can practice automation tasks:  
[https://obstaclecourse.tricentis.com/Obstacles/List](https://obstaclecourse.tricentis.com/Obstacles/List)

This repository explores how these Tosca puzzles can also be tackled using **Robot Framework** within **Visual Studio Code**.

## How to use this repository?

Here, you'll find solutions (or work-in-progress attempts) to the obstacles from the Tosca website.  
Each file corresponds to a specific obstacle, with the following naming convention:

- **Completed Obstacles**: Files are named according to the obstacle number.  
  Example: `01_puzzle1.robot`  
- **In-Progress Obstacles**: A `_` is added after the number for files that are not yet finalized.  
  Example: `02_puzzle2__.robot`

Feel free to explore, adapt, and build upon these solutions. Contributions are more than welcome! ðŸ˜Š
